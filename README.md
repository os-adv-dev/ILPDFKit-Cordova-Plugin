# ILPDFKit Plugin

Cordova plugin to [ILPDFKit](https://github.com/iwelabs/ILPDFKit), is a simple, minimalist toolkit for filling out PDF forms, which extends UIWebView and the CoreGraphics PDF C API.

This plugin defines a global ( `ILPDFKit` ) object which you can use to access the public API.


## Plugin

Although `ILPDFKit` is globally acessible, it isn't usable until `deviceready` event is called.

As with all the cordova plugins, you can listen to `deviceready` event as follows: 

```javascript
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
function onDeviceReady() {
    // ...
}
```

## Supported Platforms

 - iOS


## Installation
- Run the following command:

```shell
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/OutSystemsExperts/ILPDFKit-Cordova-Plugin.git
```
